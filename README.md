# Chatbot
This is a project for my University for the Object oriented programming class. The goal is to make an interactive chatbot which has a never ending loop and can only be exited with specific keywords such as bye or goodbye in my case. For version 3 the main idea was to remake the already made code into Object oriented code. The main concept to look out was encapsulation. Since we haven't delved into polymorphism or inheritence.
